## _**Education is our Passport to the Future, for Tomorrow belongs to the People who prepare for it Today!**_

We all understand the importance of Education and how it plays an important role in shaping our Life. With **A Brighter Future**, we present our analysis on the U.S. high school graduation rate, which aims to provide key insights on factors affecting the rate as well as actions to improve it. 

**A Brighter Future** also has a web/desktop application, with rich visualizations and dashboards for parents, teachers and the government to understand the factors affecting the graduation rate in their area, state and across the Nation and thereby, analyse it with ease for determined actions. 

Using the Insights derived from **A Brighter Future**, _Government, Communities and School Districts_ can analyse where they should focus more and undertake awareness / support programs in order to improve the graduation rate.

## Background

The U.S. national on-time high school graduation rate was only 71.7% in 2001, which went up to 81.8% based on the progress over the last decade. The **GradNation** campaign has a goal of **90%** on-time completion by 2020, for which we need to understand the factors which affect the graduation rates and thereby take actions for a cohesive environment which encourages students to complete their graduation.

And so, with **A Brighter Future**, using data driven analytics and IT solution, we are aiming to provide insights on the US education system, which can help improve the graduation rate and thereby, prepare the students for a _Brighter Tomorrow_.
